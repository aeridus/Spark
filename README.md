This app helps track regularly timed carb intake throughout the day, to even out blood sugar levels.

### Advice From A Dietitian:
* Space 3-4 hours between meals or snacks to avoid spiking or crashing blood sugar
* There should be 3 core meals in a day
* A carb serving is 15 grams
* Each core meal should be 2-4 carb servings
* Any snacks later in the day should be 1-2 carb servings

### How The App Works
* The buttons in green highlight the ideal carb servings to eat in your next meal or snack
* 3 hours from the last time you ate, you will be notified that you're Getting Hungry
* 4 hours from the last time you ate, you will be notified that you're Starving
* Recording any meal or snack in the app will reset the timer
* The last week of data is tracked to see if your carb intake is within the ideal range
* The topmost button allows you to change the theme between System/Dark/Light
* The number in the top right is the day threshold hour, adjustable with +/-
  * I recommend setting this to the middle of your usual sleep schedule
